# Hide Youtube Shorts On Everywhere (Toggle Button)

This userscript allows you to toggle the visibility of YouTube Shorts content on the platform. With a simple toggle button added to the YouTube header, you can hide or show Shorts videos as per your preference. The state of the toggle (enabled/disabled) is stored in `localStorage`, so the setting persists even after page reloads.

## Features:
- Toggle button to enable/disable YouTube Shorts content.
- Button text and background color change based on Shorts visibility.
- Persistent state using `localStorage` (remembers your choice across sessions).
- Automatically redirects from a Shorts video page to a regular video if accessed directly.

## Installation:
1. Install a userscript manager like [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io) or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/).
2. Create a new userscript and paste the code.
3. Save and enable the script.

## How to Use:
- Click the "Shorts: VISIBLE" or "Shorts: HIDDEN" button to toggle Shorts visibility on YouTube.
- The button will update its label and color to reflect the current state.
